Pharaoh's Treasures is an Egyptian themed spin-off of the classic Minesweeper game. The game takes place in the tomb of an Egyptian pharaoh. Players click on the cells to reveal gems that are randomly placed underneath, and try to avoid the scarabs that are spawned every few seconds. The objective of the game is to reveal all the cells before the tomb gets infested with beetles. The code makes use of JavaFX library and is structured according to the Model View Controller paradigm (MVC). The game is created as part of the Intro to Programming of Interactive Systems course at Université Paris-Saclay.
